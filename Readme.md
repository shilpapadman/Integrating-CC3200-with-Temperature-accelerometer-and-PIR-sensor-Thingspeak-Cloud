***Texas Instrument's CC3200 Microcontroller with Sensors and ThingSpeak Cloud...... ***


Abstract-

IoT enables us to remotely monitor surrounding parameters according to the desired applications using sensors which can wirelessly sense the real-time data and transfer them in the desired form. The sensed data can be forwarded across the network cloud via the internet connection. IoT applications use micro-controllers with on-board sensors or external sensors that can be interfaced depending upon the application. From IOT projects, we can provide and prove the strength of IoT using public platforms like the Thingspeak API that is capable of contributing services for the purpose of building vast number of IoT applications. This Design provide an efficient way of Sensing and Monitoring system in the field of Domestic and as well industrial standards to implement the IoT using a powerful MCU. The whole process involves: Sensing, Networking, Analysis and Control. This research project is done using CC3200 SimpleLink™ Wi-Fi ® Launchpad and the Energia IDE. Thingspeak is an open data platform and API for the Internet of Things that enables us to collect, store, analyze, visualize, and act on data from sensors. It also has a special feature to port the sensed data to the MATLAB R2016a using the channel ID and read API key that is assigned by services and able to track the data value at particular intervals.

Sensors used with the CC3200 Controller in this project are: 
(1)Tmp007 Temperature sensor  (2) BMA222 Accelerometer sensor(inbuilt with Microcontroller), ADXL345 accelerometer sensor (3) PIR Motion sensor.

These sensors play a major role in different real-time applications. 

Objectives-
1) This project deals with the Temperature, accelerometer and PIR-Motion sensors integrated with the CC3200 SimpleLink™ Wi- Fi ® Launchpad of Texas Instruments. 
2) The data read by the sensors are sent to the Thingspeak cloud via Wi-Fi using HTTP protocol and updated every 30 seconds. 
3) The data is analyzed in graphical and Matlab representation over the Thingspeak cloud.
4) An alert is also generated when the sensor reading falls out of the threshold values. 
5) The project also describes the role of temperature monitoring systems in Smart farming, Accelerometer detection in determining tower health, and PIR Motion detection in        security systems
